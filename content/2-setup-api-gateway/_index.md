#### SETTING UP API GATEWAY

#### Overview
In this section, you will learn how to set up **AWS API Gateway** to expose your Lambda function as a REST API. API Gateway allows you to create, deploy, and manage APIs at any scale, enabling your Lambda function to handle HTTP requests and respond to API calls from clients.

#### What is AWS API Gateway?
**AWS API Gateway** is a fully managed service that simplifies the creation, publication, maintenance, monitoring, and securing of APIs. It acts as an interface between your backend services, such as Lambda functions, and your clients. API Gateway handles tasks such as request routing, authorization, and traffic management.

#### Prerequisites
Before setting up API Gateway, ensure you have the following:

1. **AWS Account**:
   - Create an AWS account if you donâ€™t already have one.

2. **Lambda Function**:
   - You should have a Lambda function created and ready to be integrated with API Gateway.

#### Steps to Set Up API Gateway

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your credentials.
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for and select **API Gateway** from the list of services.

1. **Create a New API**:
   - Click on the **Create API** button.
   - Select **REST API** to use the advanced features.

2. **Define the Resource**:
   - Click on **Actions** and choose **Create Resource**.
   - Provide a name for the resource and click **Create Resource**.

3. **Create a Method**:
   - Select the newly created resource.
   - Click on **Actions** and choose **Create Method**.
   - Choose the HTTP verb (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and click on the checkmark to create the method.

4. **Integrate with Lambda Function**:
   - In the **Integration type** section, select **Lambda Function**.
   - Enter the name of the Lambda function you want to use.
   - Click **Save** to link the Lambda function with the API method.

5. **Deploy the API**:
   - Click on **Actions** and select **Deploy API**.
   - Choose or create a new deployment stage (e.g., `prod` or `test`).
   - Click **Deploy** to make your API available.

6. **Code Example**:
   - Here is a sample Lambda function code to handle different HTTP methods:

     ```python
     import json
     
     # Example data
     data = {
         "items": [
             {"id": 1, "name": "Item 1", "price": 10.99},
             {"id": 2, "name": "Item 2", "price": 15.99},
             {"id": 3, "name": "Item 3", "price": 20.99},
         ]
     }
     
     def lambda_handler(event, context):
         # Determine the HTTP method of the request
         http_method = event["httpMethod"]
         
         # Handle GET request
         if http_method == "GET":
             response = {
                 "statusCode": 200,
                 "body": json.dumps(data)
             }
             return response
         
         # Handle POST request
         elif http_method == "POST":
             body = json.loads(event["body"])
             data["items"].append(body)
             response = {
                 "statusCode": 200,
                 "body": json.dumps(data)
             }
             return response
         
         # Handle PUT request
         elif http_method == "PUT":
             body = json.loads(event["body"])
             for item in data["items"]:
                 if item["id"] == body["id"]:
                     item.update(body)
                     break
             response = {
                 "statusCode": 200,
                 "body": json.dumps(data)
             }
             return response
         
         # Handle DELETE request
         elif http_method == "DELETE":
             body = json.loads(event["body"])
             for i, item in enumerate(data["items"]):
                 if item["id"] == body["id"]:
                     del data["items"][i]
                     break
             response = {
                 "statusCode": 200,
                 "body": json.dumps(data)
             }
             return response
         
         else:
             response = {
                 "statusCode": 405,
                 "body": json.dumps({"error": "Method not allowed"})
             }
             return response
     ```

7. **Testing with Postman**:
   - Use the generated API endpoint to test your API.
   - Open Postman and send HTTP requests to the invoke URL to verify that the API responds correctly.
   - For GET requests, no request body is needed. For POST, PUT, and DELETE, include appropriate request bodies.

#### Conclusion
After setting up and deploying your API, use tools like Postman to ensure it functions as expected. Properly testing your API will help verify that it handles requests correctly and integrates seamlessly with your Lambda function.
